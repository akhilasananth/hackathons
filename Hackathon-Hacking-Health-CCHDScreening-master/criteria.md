# Presentation
## Background
- Critical Congenital Heart Disease screening is a provincially funded
  program, providing screening to the almost 150,000 babies born in
  Ontario each year.
- Undetected CCHD can be fatal in the first week of life
- Currently healthcare providers use a algorithm poster to evaluate
  results and paper form to document screening results. The form is
  then sent in the mail to Newborn Screening Ontario.
- NSO manually enters the data from the forms into their lab
  information system to ensure screening was done correctly.
- This quality assurance process ensures that all babies have been
  offered screening and that the screen was done correctly.

## Challenge
- The current process is subject to data entry errors, errors in
  applying the algorithm, and delays in recognizing the former.
- This is a new program and therefore there is a higher chance of
  error. Currently the error rate is about 0.5 - 1%.
- Screening errors could take days to be recognized and followed-up by
  newborn screening ontario. This delay means that an infant at risk
  for CCHD could be missed and potentially have a fatal outcome.
