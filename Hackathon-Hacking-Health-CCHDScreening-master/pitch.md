# Pitch
* Newborn Screening Ontario has started screening the almost 150,000
  babies born in Ontario each year for Critical Congenital Heart
  Disease. Currently the program uses hand written forms and snail
  mail to ensure that screening has been completed and completed
  correctly. The risk of errors and delays in the current process is high.

* We have created a mobile application that:
    * Replaces the paper forms
    * Applies the screening algorithm in real-time
    * Can transmit the data back to a server at Newborn Screening Ontario.

* We have also added:
    * Tracking of users and devices to assist in quality assurance.
    * Alerts to ensure screens are done on time.

* Newborn Screening Ontario is funded by the Province of Ontario. They
  have resources to improve the current screening process via mobile
  technology.

* ASK: You tell me? Time, money, fast cars...
