SpaceAR reminds us of why art and science should be a critical aspect of our daily lives. Join us as we embrace NASA and its data models in AR via your common video chat apps.

The model are all from NASA's 3D repository.

The astronut guides and explains the various models as they animate and are interacted with.

Sofware:
-Spark AR Studio by Facebook
-Blender or other 3D model editors or converters
-JS for scripting and animating
-Room for open space integration in the future and dynamic data loading from NASA

We are looking for volunteers to extend this platform to multiple channels.

Happy coding. @spacenaps
